# SpringBoot-RESTAPI-Microservices
Developed Microservice based Spring Boot REST API for following entity
1. Employees
2. EmployeeCards
3. Branches
4. Products
5. Towns

Developed Microservices, so that they can be generated on the database. You will have to implement a functionality for importing data from JSON and XML formats and exporting data in CSV format.

I have used MYSQL as my Database, Docker for containerization.

# List of Microservice
1. Naming Server: Eureka discovery service allows micro services to find and communicate with each other.

3. Emp Service
4. Empcard Service
5. Branch Service

# Steps to execute the Project

  Before executing the command move to respective microservice folder

4. Now execute the docker compose file using
